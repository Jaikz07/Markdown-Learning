# Markdown-Learning
understanding the concept of markdown and usage in Data Science

Basic Syntax
Below are some of the most commonly used Markdown syntax elements.

Headings
Headings are created by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
Emphasis
You can emphasize text with bold or italic formatting.

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
Lists
Unordered Lists: You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a -, *, or +.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

Ordered Lists: Ordered lists are created using numbers:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b

Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

Images
Images are similar to links, but they require an exclamation point in front, and the text inside the brackets is the alt text.

Code and Syntax Highlighting
Inline code: Use backticks code for inline code.
Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) or indent code with four spaces for blocks.
You can use backticks to create code blocks. For syntax highlighting, specify the language after the first set of backticks.

print("Hello, world!")

Task Lists
Use - [ ] for an unchecked box and - [x] for a checked box.
